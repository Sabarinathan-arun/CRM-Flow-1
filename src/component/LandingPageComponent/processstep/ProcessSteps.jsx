          How CRM Flow Saved Anchor Leathers 50% on CRM Costs and Increased
          Productivity by 30%
        </h2>
        <div className="text-img-box">
          Anchor Leathers was struggling with a costly, bulky CRM that didnâ€™t
          meet their needs, paying $500 a month for features they never used.
          They turned to CRM Flow, and we created a custom solution, built
          specifically for their business. With a one-time fee and only paying
          for updates when needed, Anchor Leathers cut their CRM costs by 50%
          and boosted productivity by 30%. Now, they have an efficient,
          streamlined system that grows with them, without unnecessary features
          or ongoing subscriptions.
