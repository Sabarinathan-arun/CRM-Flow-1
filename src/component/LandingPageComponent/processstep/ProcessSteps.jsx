        How a Custom CRM Helped Anchor Leathers Cut Costs by 50% and Increase Productivity by 30%
      </h2>

      <div className="text-img-box">
        <p>
          Anchor Leathers was using an expensive CRM platform—paying <strong>$500/month</strong> for complex features that added no value. Their business needed a <strong>custom CRM</strong>—a leaner, smarter solution aligned with real operational needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          They switched to <strong>CRM Flow</strong>, the <strong>best CRM software for small businesses</strong> looking to reduce cost and improve workflow. We built a fully tailored CRM system, optimized for <strong>lead management</strong>, sales tracking, and growth—with a simple one-time setup and flexible update model.
        </p>

        <div>
          <p>As a result, Anchor Leathers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>✅ Reduced CRM costs by <strong>50%</strong></li>
            <li>✅ Increased team productivity by <strong>30%</strong></li>
            <li>✅ Removed all unnecessary features and subscriptions</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          Now, they have a <strong>custom-built CRM</strong> that scales with their business—proving that the right CRM isn’t one-size-fits-all, but one designed for your exact workflow.
